| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| mu | Friction coefficient in primary direction (forward/backward) |
| mu2 | Friction coefficient in secondary direction (lateral/sideways) |
| slip1 | Compliance in primary direction (higher = more slip allowed) |
| slip2 | Compliance in secondary direction (higher = easier to slide sideways) |


*For drifting, we want:*

- Low `mu2` on rear wheels (easy to slide sideways)
- Higher `slip2` on rear wheels (lateral slip compliance)
- Front wheels maintain grip
